MFNode Project

The aim of this project is to explore MediaFoundation API. It provides some ways on how to use it.
This project is just experimental, and you can see it as an extension to the MediaFoundation samples.

You will find :

- audio/video player (win32)
- custom media session
- sequencer source
- audio/video capture
- screen capture
- kinect V1 capture
- wave audio mixer
- http streaming (winsock)
- jpeg encoding (Gdiplus)
- dxva2 technologie
- cuda video decoding
- directX9 renderer and shader
- COM technologie
- different kind of mediafoundation Source, Sink and Transform (mpeg2, flv, a52, vp6...)
- mp3 to wave transcoder

--------------------------------------------------

* Compilation

- This project is for Windows only, because of MediaFoundation and COM (Vista and later)
- Visual studio 2013 community (you can use an another version, not tested)
- Windows SDK v120 (you can use an another version, not tested : you will have to change project settings according to your SDK)

* optional

- NVidia GPU and Cuda SDK v6.0 (you can use an another version : you will have to change project settings according to your SDK)
- Kinect V1 SDK v1.7 (you can use an another version : you will have to change project settings according to your SDK)

All MediaFoundation Source, sink and transform need to be register with regsvr32 in order to use them. You can use a .bat file
or configure your compiler to register them (with rights administrator).


--------------------------------------------------
* general purpose

With Visual Studio i use those parameters (Tools->Options->Editor Text->C/C++) :

- Tab size         = 1
- Withdrawals size = 2
- All projects are only tested in debug mode. I don't use release mode, because MFNode Project is just experimental.


--------------------------------------------------

* Common

It contains some files used by different project, some helpers for debugging, loging, guid, and so on...
A note on macro like IF_FAILED_RETURN and others : they are usefull for debugging, but suffer from being called
twice on failure. They should be only use for debugging...


--------------------------------------------------

* Docs

- ChangeLog.txt contains a summary about updated files
- README.txt (the old one)


--------------------------------------------------

* Library used by MFNode Project :


- LibA52Audio

From http://liba52.sourceforge.net/

A decoder for ac3 audio format. I just rename .c files to .cpp files. Doing this, i can compile it
and use it without error with Visual Studio. Two projects use this library : MFSrA52Decoder and MFTA52Decoder.



- LibMpeg2

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmpeg2/ (version libmpeg2-0.5.1).

A decoder for mpeg1/mpeg2 video format. It's the original project, no modification have been made.
One project uses this library : MFTMpeg2Decoder.



- LibMpegAudio

A decoder for mp1/mp2 audio format. I use two projects :

https://sourceforge.net/projects/libmp2codec/
http://www.mpg123.de/

I rewrote the source code in a C++ way. I just keep mp1/mp2 decoding code. For mp3 decoding, MediaFoundation
provides one. Also i made things simple, it doesn't handle free format.

* The player :


- MFNodePlayer

You can see how to use some MediaFoundation API inside a WIN32 application.


-> Wave Session : uses MFTWaveMixer in a custom MediaSession.

With this session, you can mix two audio wave files (.wav) in real time. Because TopoEdit cannot handle Transform
with two input type, we need a custom MediaSession. Since Windows 8, it seems that MediaSession can handle two
input stream from a MFT. If someone can confirm.
The custom MediaSession is a derivated code from the book :
"Developing Microsoft Media Foundation Application" (thanks to Anton Polinger). Wave files must be same audio type.


-> Screen Capture Session : uses MFSrScreenCapture.

With this session, you can display your desktop.


-> Http Streamer Session : uses MFSrScreenCapture/MFTJpegEncoder and MFSkJpegHttpStreamer.

With this session, you can send desktop's frames to http application, like Vlc/Web browser.
You can use a tool like VLC and open a network stream : http://127.0.0.1:13754.


-> Flv Session : expects the flv file contains audio and video.


-> Renderer Session : uses MFSkVideoRenderer.

With this session, you can control shader's parameters from the video renderer (constrast, saturation, gray, ...).
You can use Cuda decoder or not.


-> Sequencer Session : use the sequencer source.

This session just do smooth transition between two files (.mp4), not a playlist.


-> Audio/Video Capture Session

This session show how to use MFCreateAggregateSource for different capture source.


-> Dxva2 Session : uses MFSkDxva2Renderer.

With this session, you can control Dxva2 parameters from the Dxva2 renderer (brightness, hue, contrast, ...).

The current README is not finished, check the old one from the Docs, for more informations.
I will merge both later.
